# C++ - SpaceShip Take Home Test
## Objective

This is a ment to be a simple programming exercise to gauge a participants understanding of C++. It is ment to test your understanding of: 
* Object Oriented Programming
* Abstract Classes
* Virtualization
* Coding Style and Programming Personality
* Limit Support Problem Solving
* Git

No additional information or help will be given, if you hit a road block or something is poorly defined add a comment to the ambiguous or confusing section and submit it. 

## The Test

Han Solo and Lonestar both had their spaceships repaired at a shady intergalactic repair shop and now the pattened ship design files are available to anyone who has a access the internet. The ships are simply made of from a string, a couple of enums and a well parameterized constructor. Someone graciously assembled an common interface class to allow for the construction of these two legendary spaceships, it is up to you implement the abstract classes to handle the specifics of implementation for each spaceship. Help us c-plus-plus codie, your our only hope!


Your code will be compiled and run with gcc version 9. 

## Implementation 

Here are the specs for the different spaceship implementations. You will need to write the classes, inheriting from the abstract class "Iface_SpaceShip_t" and defining the pure virtual function you intherited.
